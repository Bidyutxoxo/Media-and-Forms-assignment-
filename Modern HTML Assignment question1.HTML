In HTML, entities are a way to represent special characters or characters that would otherwise have a special meaning in HTML code. They are essentially instructions for the browser to display a specific character instead of interpreting it as part of the HTML syntax.

Here's how HTML entities work:

Entity Syntax: An entity consists of an ampersand (&), followed by the name of the character or a reference number, and terminated by a semicolon (;).

Examples:

1)&amp;: Represents an ampersand character (&)
2)&lt;: Represents a less than sign (<)
3)&gt;: Represents a greater than sign (>)
Benefits of Using HTML Entities:

Prevents Confusion: Entities ensure that special characters are displayed correctly and not misinterpreted as HTML code.
Legacy Character Encoding: Entities can be used to display characters that might not be supported by the current character encoding.
5 Commonly Used HTML Entities:

1)&amp; (ampersand): This is essential for displaying the ampersand symbol (&) itself, as it's also used to introduce entities.
2)&lt; (less than): This represents the less than sign (<), which is often used in HTML tags.
3)&gt; (greater than): This represents the greater than sign (>), also used in HTML tags.
4)&quot; (quotation mark): This displays double quotation marks (") within text content.
5)&apos; (apostrophe): This displays an apostrophe (') within text content.
