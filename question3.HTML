QUESTION4 - List any 3 ways which help us in improving the assecibility of HTML

Here are 3 ways to improve the accessibility of your HTML:

Use Semantic Elements:

Semantic elements describe the meaning and purpose of a content section, rather than just its presentation.
Instead of generic <div> tags everywhere, use elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> to structure your content.
Screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret this structure and convey it to users in a meaningful way, making navigation and comprehension easier.
Provide Alternative Text for Images (Alt Text):

The alt attribute within the <img> tag allows you to specify alternative text for an image.
This text is displayed when the image cannot be loaded or for users who rely on screen readers.
Descriptive alt text helps users understand the content and purpose of the image, improving accessibility.
Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:

Users with motor limitations or who prefer keyboard navigation should be able to access and interact with your webpage using only the keyboard.
Make sure all interactive elements like links, buttons, and form fields can be focused on and activated using the Tab key.
Use the tabindex attribute to manage the focus order if necessary.
