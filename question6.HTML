Question7-what are the benifits of using semantic in our website
There are several benefits to using semantic HTML on your website:

Improved Accessibility:

Screen Reader Compatibility: Semantic elements provide clearer meaning for screen reader software used by visually impaired users. Screen readers can interpret the structure and hierarchy of your content, allowing users to navigate and understand the webpage more effectively.

Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO):

Search Engine Understanding: While search engines don't directly rely on semantic elements for ranking, they can use them to better understand the content and context of your webpage. This can potentially improve your search ranking as search engines can deliver more relevant results to user queries

Maintainability and Code Readability:

Clearer Code Structure: Semantic elements make your HTML code more organized and easier to understand. Using descriptive tags like <header>, <nav>, and <article> clearly conveys the purpose of each section, improving code readability for yourself and other developers working on the project.
